# Valentine's Google Doodle
My google doodle is going to be for Valentine's Day. I am either going to have hearts falling down and forming the letters of"google" or have cupid shoot an arrow through a heart and have the word google fade in. It's going to be very girly and cute with a pink and red color scheme.
